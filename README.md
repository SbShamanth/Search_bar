Overview:
The Contact Name Search Application is a web-based tool developed using the React.js library, featuring modern JavaScript techniques and leveraging React hooks such as useState, useEffect, and useNavigate. The primary functionality of the application is to allow users to search for specific contact names stored in a local server, retrieve their associated email addresses, and display the results.

Key Features:

Search Functionality: The application provides users with a search bar where they can input contact names to search for. Upon submission, the application queries the local server to retrieve matching contact names.
State Management: React's useState hook is utilized for managing the state of the search query and search results, ensuring efficient and reactive updates to the user interface.
Effect Handling: The useEffect hook is employed to trigger side effects, such as fetching data from the local server or updating the UI based on changes in the search query or search results.
Navigation Handling: React Router's useNavigate hook is used for navigation within the application, allowing seamless transitions between different views and states.
Data Retrieval: Axios is utilized for making HTTP requests to the local server's API endpoints, enabling data retrieval and manipulation (e.g., fetching contact names, creating new contacts).
User Interface: The application's user interface is designed using Font Awesome icons for the search bar logo, providing an intuitive and visually appealing experience for users.
Technologies Used:

React.js: JavaScript library for building user interfaces, facilitating the creation of dynamic and interactive components.
useState, useEffect, useNavigate: React hooks for managing component state, handling side effects, and managing navigation within the application.
React Router: Library for declarative routing in React applications, enabling navigation between different views and states.
Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for making requests to API endpoints, facilitating communication with the local server.
Font Awesome: Icon library used for creating visually appealing UI elements, such as the search bar logo.
Project Structure:

App.js: Main component orchestrating the application's functionality, including routing, state management, and API interaction.
SearchBar.js: Component rendering the search bar interface, allowing users to input search queries.
SearchResults.js: Component displaying the search results retrieved from the local server based on the user's query.
api.js: Module containing functions for interacting with the local server's API endpoints using Axios for fetching and creating contact data.
styles.css: Stylesheet containing CSS rules for styling the components and ensuring a cohesive and visually appealing user interface.
How to Use:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install dependencies using npm or yarn.
Start the local server and React application.
Access the application through the provided URL and use the search bar to search for contact names.
View the search results, which include the associated email addresses retrieved from the local server.
Future Enhancements:

Implement advanced search functionality, such as filtering by additional criteria (e.g., email address, phone number).
Integrate user authentication and authorization to ensure secure access to contact data.
Enhance error handling and validation for improved user feedback and error resilience.
Optimize performance by implementing server-side pagination and caching mechanisms for large datasets.
